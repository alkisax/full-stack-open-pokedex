# Continuous Integration for a Java Project

In a small team of six developers working on a Java application, setting up Continuous Integration (CI) helps catch issues early and automate the development process. A good CI setup usually includes **linting**, **testing**, and **building** the application every time someone pushes code.

## Linting, Testing, and Building in Java

- **Linting (Code Style Checks):** Java tools like **Checkstyle**, **PMD**, and **SpotBugs** are used to find code style issues or possible bugs. These tools help keep the code clean and readable.

- **Testing:** Most Java developers use **JUnit** to write and run unit tests. Another option is **TestNG**. These frameworks help ensure that the code works as expected before it's deployed.

- **Building:** Java projects are usually built with tools like **Maven** or **Gradle**. These tools compile the code, run the tests, and package the application into a `.jar` or `.war` file.

## Alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are other CI tools that are easy to use:
- **Travis CI** – simple to set up with GitHub.
- **CircleCI** – fast and flexible.
- **GitLab CI/CD** – works well if you already use GitLab.
- **Bitbucket Pipelines** – built into Bitbucket.

These services automatically run your tests and builds in the cloud.

## Self-Hosted vs. Cloud-Based CI

For a small team, a **cloud-based** CI setup is usually better. It’s easier to start with and requires no server maintenance. Tools like GitHub Actions and CircleCI work right out of the box.

A **self-hosted** setup (like running Jenkins on your own server) might be better if your app has **strict security needs**, if you need full control, or if you want to avoid cloud costs in the long term.

To choose between them, you need to consider:
- Budget
- Security requirements
- Team’s experience
- Infrastructure availability

Cloud CI is usually the simplest and fastest option to get started.
